                    Mathematics - Maths has always been an integral part of my life. From a young age, I have loved
                    problem solving, and breaking down complex problems! I started Mathletes as a way to share my
                    knowledge, that I have gained over the past few years, with students. The beautiful thing about
                    Maths is the fact that you can solve problems in so many different ways. Therefore, through this
                    program, I want to teach students unique methods of approaching problems.</div>
